# Graph Dungeon Generator
## Description
This project generates game dungeons similar to the first zelda dungeons with only normal keys (no key items or breakable walls). The code is based on Joris Dormans' work in [dungeon generation](http://sander.landofsand.com/publications/Dormans_Bakkes_-_Generating_Missions_and_Spaces_for_Adaptable_Play_Experiences.pdf) for [Unexplored](https://store.steampowered.com/app/506870/Unexplored/).

## Features
- generate a graph of mission graph that describe how to solve the level similar to Mark Brown's Graph in [Boss Keys series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_ul4D6OChdWhsNsYY3NA5B2)
- generate a 2D equal size room layout for the mission graph similar to the [first zelda dungeon layout](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6582/learning_from_the_masters_level_.php?print=1)
